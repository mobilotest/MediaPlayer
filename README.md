# MediaPlayer
New Project for Google Nano-degree #UdacityLevelUp

The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a GridView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.

Data about each song should be stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.
